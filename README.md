- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashraful (@kmashraful)
  
- 👀 My main research interests are in geospatial analysis, remote sensing, urban microclimate, environmental modeling, and earth system processes. I am keen on obtaining geographic, climatic, temporal, and spatial insights through fundamental and applied research, system digitalization, and modeling using a variety of methodologies, such as machine learning and deep learning, in order to improve planning, decision-making, and functioning. I am also interested in studying and evaluating how people use the physical space around them. Finally, the goal is to contribute to the creation of a world in which meticulous spatial allocation of places ensures that civic life remains free of inconveniences.
